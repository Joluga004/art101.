    <h1>Lab Structure</h1>
    <p> We had to set up a cascading type of file structure. Where we could identify the parent and child and sometimes grandparent. The process
        should help us maintain a clean code. 
    </p>
    <h2> Issues</h2>
    <p> The creation of the files was the easiest part, Wes had already provided 
        us with a template. However, the course moves really fast so sometimes one 
        can forget about the small details. Like linking a css style sheet. 
    </p>
    <h3> Results</h3>
    <p>I think the file structure came out fine.</p>
